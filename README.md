govt-urls
=========

As the U.S. government’s official web portals, USA.gov and GobiernoUSA.gov seek to have a comprehensive search across all federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government websites. 

We have posted the URLs in two files:

* government-urls-alphabetic-list.txt -- a list of the domains with accompanying notes collected over time
* government-urls-hierarchical-list.txt -- a flat list of domains segmented by state abbreviations

Marilyn Kercher started this list long ago. She took it as her personal mission to ensure that people could find information on government web sites that do not end in .gov. 

We hope that this list helps shine a light on where government information lives, and we welcome comments and additions.

Thank you,
