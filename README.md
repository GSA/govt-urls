As the U.S. government's official web portal, [USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov) and its Spanish counterpart [GobiernoUSA.gov](http://www.usa.gov/gobiernousa/) search across all federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government websites. Most government websites end in .gov or .mil, but many end in .com, .org, .edu, or other top-level domains.

This is a list of government URLs that don't end in .gov or .mil.

# How is this list organized?

We maintain this list at <http://govt-urls.usa.gov/tematres/vocab/index.php> and make periodic updates as we come across changes.

Each quarter, we also post the URLs here in Github in three files.

1. [Alphabetic](/government-urls-alphabetic-list.txt)&mdash;an A-Z list of URLs with accompanying notes and relationships collected over time.
2. [Hierarchical](/government-urls-hierarchical-list.txt)&mdash;a flat list of URLs segmented by category (see BT description in the following section).
3. [YAML](/government-urls.yaml)&mdash;a mapping file of the URLs for applications.


Cross reference symbols that you'll find in the alphabetic list include:

* **BT (broader term)**&mdash;indicates the category for each URL, such as federal (usagovFED) or state, commonwealth, or territory (usagov__, 2-letter [postal abbreviation](https://www.usps.com/send/official-abbreviations.htm)).
* **NT (narrower term)**&mdash;the opposite of BT. 
* **UF (used for)**&mdash;indicates the nonpreferred URL. Nonpreferred URLs no longer resolve or redirect to another URL. UF is the reciprocal of USE and means "don't use" the term following it.
* **USE**&mdash;indicates the preferred, resolving URL. "Use" the term following it.
* **RTET (related equivalent term)**&mdash;indciates two URLs that both resolve to the same website. Neither is preferred. 
* **RT (related term)**&mdash;indicates an association between two related terms when it seems helpful. 


# A Tip of the Hat

A tip of the hat to Marilyn Kercher. She started this list many years ago and took it as her personal mission to ensure you can find information from any government website&mdash;including those that don't end in .gov or .mil&mdash;when you search on [USA.gov](http://www.usa.gov). She would be thrilled to learn that this list is now open for anyone to access.
